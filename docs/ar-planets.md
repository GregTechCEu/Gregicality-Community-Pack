## Plans
- Mercury could be very metal rich
- Venus could be useful to get sulfur
- Earth is...Earth
- The moon should gate dilithium
- Mars could have some ferrite sand
- Jupiter can be used for gas mining
- Io could be used for geothermal energy and more sulfur
- Europa has lots of ice and water
- Ganymede and Callisto I'll have to think more about
- Saturn can be gas mined too
- Titan is full of hydrocarbons (don't tell the americans)
- Uranus can be gas mined
- Neptune can be gas mined
- Triton I'll have to think about more
- Pluton Charon and Sedna could be pretty cool, they are very far out, especially Sedna
